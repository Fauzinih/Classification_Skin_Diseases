# Classification of Skin Disease Using CNN MobileNetV2

This project aims to develop an image classification model for detecting **skin diseases** using a deep learning approach, specifically the **MobileNetV2** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model is designed to classify skin conditions into three categories: **urticaria**, **smallpox**, and **tinea versicolor**, based on input skin images.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Skin diseases are common health issues with a high prevalence that can significantly affect quality of life. Early detection plays a crucial role, especially in areas with limited access to medical services. This project leverages deep learning to assist in the **early screening** of skin diseases through digital image analysis.

## üß† Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- MobileNetV2 (pre-trained CNN)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## üìÅ Dataset Structure

The dataset contains a total of **396 images**, split into:
- **318 training images**
- **78 testing images**

Organized into three classes:
- `urticaria/`
- `smallpox/`
- `tinea_versicolor/`

Each class is stored in its own subfolder.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Training Steps

1. Load and preprocess images (resize, optional augmentation)
2. Use MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor
3. Add classification layers (Dense layer)
4. Compile the model with:
   - Optimizer: `Adam`
   - Loss Function: `categorical_crossentropy`
   - Metric: `accuracy`
5. Train the model for **20 epochs**
6. Evaluate using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score

## üìä Evaluation Results

The model achieved strong classification performance and demonstrated stable generalization to new, unseen images. Evaluation metrics included confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## üìå Conclusion

The MobileNetV2-based CNN model is capable of classifying skin diseases from digital images with promising results. It shows potential as an **early detection tool** for assisting healthcare professionals, particularly in under-resourced settings.
